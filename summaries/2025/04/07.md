# Activity Summary for 4/7/2025

## 7:44:59 PM
The log shows a series of modifications to `post_re.py` between 6:48 PM and 7:08 PM on April 7th, 2025, focusing on making POST requests to different Pipedream URLs.  Initially, GET requests were used, then it shifted to POST requests.  The URLs changed multiple times.  Between 7:04 PM and 7:08 PM, the code evolved to include a JSON payload with `username` and `age` data, refining how the data is sent in the POST request (from `data` keyword argument to `json` keyword argument).  Minor changes were also made to the formatting of the JSON data.

A separate logging script (`log.py`) was added at approximately 7:44 PM, appearing in two different directories. This script uses the `requests` library to make a GET request to `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/commentscodemate` and includes basic error logging to an 'app.log' file.  The code for this script is identical in both instances, except for the filepaths.
