# Activity Summary for 4/26/2025

## 10:14:01 PM
The log shows development activity on a Langchain project.  On April 26th, 2025, at 9:25 PM, a `requirements.txt` file was updated, specifying numerous Python packages for Langchain, including core components, integrations with OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, and Hugging Face, along with utilities like NumPy and scikit-learn.  Shortly after, at 9:26 PM, a `test.py` file was created or modified, seemingly to check the Langchain version.  The log indicates that no further analysis will be made on other files such as `.env` files containing sensitive information.

The log shows development of code using Langchain to interact with different LLMs.  The `1_llm_demo.py` file was initially set up to use OpenAI's `gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct` model, evolving from a simple model invocation to one that prints the result of querying the capital of India.

Between 10:38 PM and 10:55 PM, the `1_chatmodel_openai.py` file was developed to utilize the OpenAI's ChatOpenAI model.  It started with basic setup and progressed to  using `gpt-4`, then further incorporating parameters like `temperature` and `max_completion_tokens` to control the response, demonstrating increasing sophistication in prompt engineering.  Specifically, at 10:55:22 PM the code was modified to generate a poem using the `gpt-4` model.

A second chat model file, `2_chatmodel_anthropic.py`, was created at 10:59:42 PM, integrating the Anthropic's `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022` model.  This file directly prints the result of querying for India's capital.

Finally, the `.env` file was updated multiple times to include API keys for OpenAI and Anthropic, and later Google.  The  `OPENAI_API_KEY` remained consistent throughout the updates.  The significant changes in the `.env` file were adding the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` at 11:01:44 PM and  the `GOOGLE_API_KEY` at 11:09:45 PM.  This indicates an expansion of the project to incorporate different LLM providers.
