The log shows a single code update to `d:\ML\Webscraping\EbayProject\ebay.py` on 4/14/2025 at 11:36:16 PM.  This Python script scrapes data from a specific eBay product page (URL hardcoded in the script).  It uses the `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` libraries to fetch and parse the HTML. The script extracts the product title, price, image URLs, and available colors.  The extracted data is then saved as a JSON file named `out.json`.  The script demonstrates a basic web scraping workflow, focusing on specific CSS selectors to target the desired information.  A key pattern is the use of `soup.select_one()` and `soup.find_all()` to locate elements based on their CSS classes.
