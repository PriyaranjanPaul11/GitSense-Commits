# Activity Summary for 4/13/2025

## 2:25:25 PM
The file `d:\ML\Webscraping\BasicPROJ\bookstoscrape.py` underwent two significant updates on April 13th, 2025.  The first update (1:29:09 PM) established a basic web scraping script using `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` to fetch and parse the `books.toscrape.com` website, printing the first book's HTML element. The second update (2:24:50 PM) significantly expanded the script's functionality.  It now iterates through all book elements, extracting and printing the product link (combining the base URL with the relative link), image source (similarly combining with the base URL), title, price, and rating for each book.  This indicates a progression from simply retrieving data to actively processing and extracting specific information from the scraped HTML.  The recurring element is the use of BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML structure of the webpage for information extraction.
