# Activity Summary for 4/30/2025

## 12:47:59 PM
The log shows changes to a `.env` file containing API keys and a Python script (`4_chatmodel_hf_api.py`) utilizing the Hugging Face API for language models.

The `.env` file was updated twice on April 30th, 2025.  The first update (11:50:10 AM)  initialized API keys for OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and Hugging Face Hub. The second update (12:41:28 PM)  modified only the Hugging Face Hub access token, suggesting a token refresh or change.

The Python script `4_chatmodel_hf_api.py` was also modified twice on the same day. The initial version (11:52:38 AM) used the `mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3` model. The second version (12:45:13 PM), shortly after the `.env` file update, switched to the `TinyLlama/TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0` model.  Both versions performed the same task: querying the model to determine India's capital and printing the result.  The modifications demonstrate a change in the selected language model within the application.
