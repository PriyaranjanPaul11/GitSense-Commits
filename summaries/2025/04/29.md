# Activity Summary for 4/29/2025

## 5:42:59 PM
The log shows development of a PDF summarization tool using Streamlit.

The `requirements.txt` file was updated twice on April 29th, 2025, around 5:18 PM and 5:20 PM,  specifying the necessary libraries `streamlit` and `langchain`.  The order of these libraries was adjusted between these two commits.

The `test.py` file underwent several changes between 5:23 PM and 5:37 PM on the same day.  Initially, it only contained a simple import statement for `streamlit`.  Subsequent changes added a basic Streamlit application which includes:

*   Setting the page configuration and title ("PDF Summarizer").
*   Displaying introductory text.
*   A file uploader for PDF files.
*   A "Generate Summary" button.

There were several minor commits to `test.py` between 5:30 PM and 5:35 PM, appearing to be saves without functional changes. The most significant change to `test.py`  was at approximately 5:37 PM, when the page title was corrected from "PDF_Summerizer" to "PDF Summarizer" and a title was added using `st.title()`.  The application's functionality remained consistent throughout these changes.
