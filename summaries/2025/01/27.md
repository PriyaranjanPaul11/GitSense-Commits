# Activity Summary for 1/27/2025

## 12:41:50 AM
The log shows a series of edits to `d:\ML\Webscraping\0_retrieving_html.py` focused on web scraping, and a single creation of `d:\ML\Webscraping\1_bs4.py` for HTML parsing.

`0_retrieving_html.py` initially scraped `https://www.drugs.com/drug_information.html`.  Subsequent changes shifted the target URL to `https://www.flipkart.com/search?q=mobiles...` (a Flipkart mobile search).  Between 11:52 PM on 1/26/2025 and 12:06:50 AM on 1/27/2025, the code evolved, adding features to improve robustness:

* **Improved HTTP requests:** The code progressed from a simple `requests.get()` to using `requests.session()` for persistent connections and incorporating custom headers including a randomized `User-Agent` via the `fake_useragent` library to mimic browser behavior and avoid bot detection.  The inclusion of `Accept-Language`, `Accept-Encoding`, `Connection`, and `referer` headers further refined the request.

* **Error Handling (implicit):** The addition of `print(r.status_code)` (briefly present) suggests an attempt to monitor the success of the HTTP request.

* **Rate Limiting:** A `time.sleep(2)` was added to introduce a two-second pause between requests, potentially to avoid overloading the target website.

Finally, the target URL was changed back to a drugs.com URL (`https://www.drugs.com/alpha/a.html`) at 12:29:38 AM on 1/27/2025, indicating the possible scope of the scraping project may involve multiple URLs.  The final version of the script uses only `requests.get()` again, removing the session management and some headers.

`1_bs4.py`, created at 12:18:10 AM on 1/27/2025, uses Beautiful Soup to parse the HTML content saved in "file.html", demonstrating the next step in processing the scraped data.
