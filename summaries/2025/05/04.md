# Activity Summary for 5/4/2025

## 5:35:07 PM
The log shows the development of several Python scripts using Langchain to interact with large language models (LLMs).  The primary LLM used is `google/gemma-2-2b-it` accessed via the HuggingFace API.  Several different output parsers are explored: `StrOutputParser`, `StructuredOutputParser`, `JsonOutputParser`, and `PydanticOutputParser`.

`stroutputparser.py` (4:33:13 PM): This initial script uses a simple two-prompt chain.  The first prompt requests a detailed report, and the second summarizes the generated report. Both prompts use `PromptTemplate` for structuring. The model used is  `ChatHuggingFace`.

`stroutputparser1.py` (4:44:56 PM & 4:45:39 PM): This script undergoes two revisions. The first version uses `ChatOpenAI`. The second revision replaces it with `ChatHuggingFace`, mirroring the LLM used in `stroutputparser.py`.  Both versions employ a chain combining `PromptTemplate`, the LLM, and `StrOutputParser`, creating a more sophisticated two-prompt chain than the first script.

`structuredoutputparser.py` (4:48:23 PM): This script uses `StructuredOutputParser` to parse the LLM's response into a structured format defined by `ResponseSchema`,  requesting three facts about a topic.

`jsonoutputparser.py` (4:49:51 PM):  This script uses `JsonOutputParser` to parse the LLM's response into JSON format,  requesting five facts about a topic.

`pydanticoutputparser.py` (4:50:57 PM): This script uses `PydanticOutputParser` to parse the LLM's response into a Pydantic model (`Person`), extracting name, age, and city.


A recurring pattern is the use of  `PromptTemplate` to define prompts and `HuggingFaceEndpoint` to access the  `google/gemma-2-2b-it` model. The scripts demonstrate experimentation with different output parsers to handle the LLM's responses efficiently.  The "black hole" topic is consistently used for testing.  The significant changes happen between 4:44 PM and 4:50 PM, when the different output parsers are implemented and tested.
