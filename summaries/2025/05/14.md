# Activity Summary for 5/14/2025

## 12:27:40 AM
The log shows development of a Jupyter Notebook generation agent.  The key changes revolve around prompt engineering and the agent's backend logic.

`subtasks_prompts.j2` (5/13/2025, 11:31:54 PM) and `subtasks_prompt.j2` (5/13/2025, 11:46:12 PM) are nearly identical Jinja2 templates. They define a prompt instructing a language model to break down a given coding task into a list of concise, self-contained subtasks.  The later version is likely a refinement or a corrected copy.


`nb_agent_ui.py` (5/13/2025, 11:34:37 PM) implements a Streamlit user interface.  Users upload files (optional), describe a task, and specify an output notebook filename. The UI then displays subtasks generated by the backend, streams the agent's notebook creation process, showing tool calls, model outputs, observations, and final outputs. Finally it offers a download for the generated Jupyter Notebook.  The UI uses custom CSS for improved visual presentation.

`nb_agent_backend.py` (5/13/2025, 11:43:03 PM) contains the core logic. It selects a language model (allowing for several providers like Hugging Face, OpenAI, etc.), renders prompts using Jinja2 templates (`subtasks_prompt.j2` and `nb_agent_prompt.j2`), and uses a `CodeAgent` to generate subtasks and then the notebook itself.  The agent uses tools for adding markdown and running code cells.  The code demonstrates a clear separation of concerns between the user interface and the backend logic for model selection and task processing.  The selection of the language model is configurable and demonstrates support for several options.  The use of an environment variable for API keys suggests a design aimed at flexibility and avoiding hardcoding sensitive information.
