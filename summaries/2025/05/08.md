# Activity Summary for 5/8/2025

## 12:25:17 AM
The log shows extensive experimentation with Langchain's runnable components, primarily `RunnableSequence`,  alongside `RunnableParallel`, `RunnablePassthrough`, `RunnableBranch`, and `RunnableLambda`.  The core functionality involves creating chains of prompts and LLMs to generate and explain jokes.

The `runnable_sequence.py` file underwent the most revisions.  Initially, it used `ChatOpenAI` (11:29:17 PM), then switched to using `HuggingFaceEndpoint` with various Hugging Face model IDs at different times: "google/gemma-2-2b-it" (11:30:09 PM),  "google/gemma-2b-it" (11:34:24 PM), "mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2" (11:36:08 PM), "Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2" (11:37:54 PM), "nari-labs/Dia-1.6B" (11:39:27 PM), and finally "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-Prover-V2-671B" (11:40:38 PM and 11:47:50 PM).  This indicates testing different LLMs for joke generation and explanation.  The `.env` file was updated multiple times (11:28:47 PM, 11:37:15 PM, 11:47:16 PM) to change the `HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN`, suggesting a need for multiple API keys for different experiments.


Other files demonstrated more specific functionalities:

* **`runnable_passthrough.py` (11:30:30 PM):** This file introduced `RunnableParallel` and `RunnablePassthrough` to generate and explain a joke concurrently.

* **`runnable_lambda.py` (11:31:18 PM):** This file integrated `RunnableLambda` to add a word count to the joke's output.

* **`runnable_branch.py` (11:31:23 PM and 11:31:32 PM):** This file showcased the use of `RunnableBranch` for conditional processing: summarizing a report if it exceeds 300 words.  This file only had two minor updates with the same code, so it's likely a duplicate or accidental edit.

The overarching pattern is iterative experimentation with different LLMs and Langchain's runnable features to build sophisticated text-processing pipelines. The frequent changes to the Hugging Face model IDs and API tokens suggest a focused effort to evaluate the performance of various models for joke generation and explanation tasks.
