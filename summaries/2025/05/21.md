# Activity Summary for 5/21/2025

## 11:37:15 PM
The log shows three consecutive edits to the `.gitignore` file located in a Langchain_models project directory.  The changes all relate to ignoring `.env` and `venv` directories from version control.  The initial commit (10:37:57 PM) included `.env` and `venv` on separate lines. Subsequent edits (10:42:45 PM and 10:42:54 PM) refined the entry to a single line, first combining them without a leading slash, and finally adding a leading slash to explicitly ignore those directories in any subdirectories.  The edits were made within a short timeframe (approximately 5 minutes).
