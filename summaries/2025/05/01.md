# Activity Summary for 5/1/2025

## 7:51:57 PM
The log shows iterative development of a chatbot using the `HuggingFaceHub` LLM from the Langchain library.  The primary file modified is `chatbot.py`.

Initially (6:54 PM - 7:02 PM), the code was developed to utilize the `HuggingFaceHub` model with a basic conversational loop.  Several minor revisions during this period focused on debugging print statements related to the `result` object returned by `model.invoke()`. There was also a small change to how the `result` was handled when appending to `chat_history`.

A significant change occurred at 7:08 PM, switching the model from `HuggingFaceHub` to `HuggingFaceEndpoint`,  integrating an API token from the environment for authentication with the Hugging Face Inference API.  Error handling was also added using a `try-except` block.  However, this change was short-lived, and the code reverted back to `HuggingFaceHub` at 7:08:48 PM.

Between 7:16 PM and 7:26 PM, there's a series of modifications focusing on debugging and print statementsâ€”investigating the types of messages (`HumanMessage`, `SystemMessage`) within the `chat_history`.  During this period, the AI response handling was also adjusted and simplified.


From 7:30 PM onwards, the code underwent further refinement.  Initially, the system message was removed from `chat_history` (7:30 PM), then added back (7:31 PM). A more substantial change at 7:37 PM modified the `model.invoke()` call to use only the last five messages from the `chat_history` before appending the AI response.   Subsequent changes (7:39 PM - 7:50 PM) refined this further, using only the last message in the chat history for the LLM's input, and final adjustments were made to properly print the AI response. The final version (7:50 PM) uses only the last message and keeps the response handling more concise. Also, the `max_new_tokens` parameter was reduced from 512 to 250.
