# Activity Summary for 5/22/2025

## 2:01:39 PM
The log shows a single code change to `test.py` on May 22, 2025, at 1:06:12 PM.  This Python script uses the `streamlit` library to create a PDF summarization web application.  The application allows users to upload a PDF file, and upon clicking a "Generate Summary" button, it generates a summary using a function `summarizer` (presumably defined in a `utils` module).  The script includes placeholder code for setting an OpenAI API key from environment variables.  The core functionality revolves around file uploading, button interaction, and displaying the generated summary.  No patterns or recurring elements are evident beyond the standard structure of a Streamlit application.
