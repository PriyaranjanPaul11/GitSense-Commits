# Activity Summary for 6/10/2025

## 7:04:43 PM
The log shows a single entry for `main.py` on June 10th, 2025 at 6:43:22 PM. This file contains a basic FastAPI application with two endpoints: a root path ("/") returning "Hello, World!", and an "/about" path returning a description of the application.  The code uses the `FastAPI` library to define and run the application.  No patterns or recurring elements beyond the consistent use of FastAPI are evident in this single entry.
