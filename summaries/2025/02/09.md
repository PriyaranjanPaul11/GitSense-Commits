# Activity Summary for 2/9/2025

## 4:34:05 PM
The log shows a single code change to `c:\Users\pault\OneDrive\Desktop\c++\point.cpp\min.cpp` on February 9th, 2025 at 2:27:45 PM.  This file contains a C++ function `getMin` that finds the minimum element in an integer array. The `main` function takes integer array input from the user, calls `getMin` to find the minimum, and then prints the result. The code uses a simple iterative approach to find the minimum value.  Notably, the array `num` is declared with a fixed size of 100, which might be inefficient for larger inputs.  The code also includes `<bits/stdc++.h>`, which is generally discouraged for its potential to introduce unnecessary dependencies.
