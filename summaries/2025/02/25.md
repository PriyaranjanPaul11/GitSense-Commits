# Activity Summary for 2/25/2025

## 7:26:43 PM
The log shows the development of a simple Django-based to-do list application.  The initial changes (around 6:53 PM) focused on setting up the `settings.py` file, configuring standard Django settings like database, security, and middleware.

Between 6:56 PM and 7:01 PM, the URL routing was configured.  `tasks/urls.py` defines a basic URL pattern, and `todo/urls.py` includes it, directing the root URL to the task list. A minor edit to `todo/urls.py` at 7:01:07 PM simply improved the import statement to use `path, include` instead of two separate statements.

A basic template for the task list (`tasks/templates/tasks/list.html`) was created around 7:04 PM and slightly updated at 7:06 PM.  Simultaneously, the view (`tasks/views.py`) that renders this template was created at 7:05 PM.

Finally, the model (`tasks/models.py`) defining the `Task` object (with title, completion status, and creation timestamp) was created and remained unchanged between 7:13 PM and 7:22 PM.  The model was registered with Django's admin interface at 7:11 PM.  There were no changes made to it afterwards, suggesting it was finalized at that point.
