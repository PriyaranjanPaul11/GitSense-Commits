# Activity Summary for 2/8/2025

## 2:08:17 PM
The log shows development of linked list functionalities in C++.  The `createLikedList.cpp` file underwent several minor revisions between 1:14 PM and 1:18 PM on February 8th, 2025, primarily experimenting with accessing different elements of an array to initialize the linked list head node.  These changes were not substantial, with the core Node class and `main` function remaining largely unchanged.


The `traversingLL.CPP` file (note the capitalization difference) shows more significant changes between 2:03 PM and 2:04 PM on the same day. A `convertArr2LL` function was added to convert an array into a linked list.  Initial versions of this file included an incomplete `lengthOfLL` function that printed the linked list but didn't return the length.  A further revision corrected a loop iteration in `convertArr2LL`, changing the starting index from 0 to 1, and a final edit removed the printing from `lengthOfLL` leaving only the length calculation.

Finally, `lengthOfLL.cpp` file was created around 2:06 PM and was subsequently updated twice in quick succession (2:07 PM). The primary change was correcting the `lengthOfLL` function to correctly return the calculated length instead of just printing the list and changing the return type of main function to 0.  This file reuses the `convertArr2LL` function and Node class structure already established in `traversingLL.CPP`.  The consistent use of a `Node` class and the `convertArr2LL` function across multiple files suggests a modular design approach.
