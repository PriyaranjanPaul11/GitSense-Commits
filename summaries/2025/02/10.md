# Activity Summary for 2/10/2025

## 2:21:05 PM
The log shows modifications to a Django application dealing with Chai varieties, reviews, stores, and certificates.

The `chai/models.py` file underwent two revisions on February 10th, 2025.  The first revision (1:21:07 PM) defined models for `ChaiVarity`, `ChaiReview` (a one-to-many relationship with `ChaiVarity`), and `Store` (a many-to-many relationship with `ChaiVarity`). The second revision (1:44:05 PM) added a `ChaiCertificate` model, establishing a one-to-one relationship with `ChaiVarity`.

The `chai/admin.py` file was also modified twice on February 10th, 2025. The first revision (2:14:42 PM) registered the models in the Django admin interface, using `TabularInline` for ChaiReviews within the ChaiVarity admin,  and configured `list_display` and `filter_horizontal` options for improved admin display and management. The second revision (2:16:27 PM) removed `filter_horizontal` from `StoreAdmin`, suggesting a change in how chai varieties are managed within the store admin interface.  The changes made to the admin are minor and mostly focus on presentation and usability.
