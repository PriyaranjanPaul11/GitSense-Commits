# Activity Summary for 2/19/2025

## 6:48:52 PM
The log shows development of a simple Django website.  Initial commits at around 5:52 PM set up the project's basic structure (settings.py, urls.py).  The `base` app was created, routing the homepage to a `home` view (base/urls.py). The homepage initially displayed only "Hello World" (base/templates/base/home.html).

Around 6:00 PM onwards, significant changes were made:

* **`base/templates/base/home.html` (6:32 PM):**  A stylesheet (main.css) and an image (`priyaranjanpaul`) were added to the homepage.

* **`mywebsite/settings.py` (6:33 PM & 6:36 PM):**  The settings file was updated multiple times to configure static files.  `STATIC_URL` was changed to `'staticfiles/'`, `MEDIA_URL` was added as `'images/'`, and `STATICFILES_DIRS` was set to include a `staticfiles` directory. The addition of `import os` suggests a path manipulation was required for the static files directory.  This indicates the application of static file management within the Django settings.

* **`staticfiles/css/main.css` (6:35 PM):** A simple CSS file was added, styling the `<h3>` tag with red text.

* **`base/templates/base/home.html` (6:38 PM):** The image path was corrected to `priyaranjanpaul.jpeg`.

In summary, the changes reflect a progressive enhancement of the homepage from a simple text-based display to a page with styling and an image, involving adjustments to the project's URL configuration, template, static files, and Django settings to accommodate the new assets.  The repeated edits to settings.py show iterative refinements in the static file handling configuration.
